# WCA-SAT
ðŸŒŠ Window Cleaning Assistant (WCA) This was an overly ambitious school project for my Software Development class in Year 12 (2020). A SAT is a School Assessed Task

At the moment I am continuing to work on this project in a Private repo, but I thought I would make this public so other students can learn a thing or two!

Keep in mind this code was written while I was still learning programming fundamentals, so it's pretty terrible...
Feel free to contact me if you need any help with your VCE Software Development SAT!


To run this code, simply open PyCharm, clone this repo, initialize your virtual environment, install all of the requirements in requirements.txt (PyCharm should automatically ask if you if you would like to install all dependencies, click 'Yes.')

In the login GUI, stay in offline mode, unless you have your own MQTT server you can connect to, then type in class as the password and hit enter on your keyboard.
