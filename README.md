# WCA-SAT
ðŸŒŠ Window Cleaning Assistant (WCA) This was an overly ambitious school project for my Software Development class in Year 12 (2020). A SAT is a School Assessed Task

At the moment I am continuing to work on this project in a Private repo, but I thought I would make this public so other students can learn a thing or two!

Keep in mind this code was written while I was still learning programming fundamentals, so it's pretty terrible...
